          question: `How do I get a reliable football prediction?`,
          answer: `<p>The question is not necessarily how to get a reliable prediction, but what makes a football prediction reliable. The reliability of a football prediction results from a sum of criteria, with the criterion being assigned a weight in order to weight the reliability of the prediction. For example, Winflix uses a database of about fifteen criteria to get the most reliable prediction possible. Finally, some imponderables must be taken into account, which can completely destroy the reliability of the forecast. We think in particular of game actions in a football game, such as a red card or the absence of an important player in the squad. Obviously, the absence of a team's top scorer inevitably affects the reliability of the result. However, since football is a game involving 11 outfield players, the absence of a single player being replaced by a slightly less productive player has little impact on the stats supporting the prediction, only if it is the influence of the player, the Game is game in question has no decisive influence on the outcome of the game. In summary, for a reliable football prediction it is necessary to work on fifteen criteria.</p>`
        },
        {
          question: `How do I find the right football prediction?`,
          answer: `<p>Great question! Not all football predictions are necessarily good. To find a good soccer prediction, you need to spend a lot of time analyzing without excluding the key criteria of the sports game, or following sports betting experts or soccer predictions. In any case, finding a football at-risk player requires research, time or knowledge coupled with an accurate and professional follow-up of football-related news.</p>`,
        },
        {
          question: `How can the prognosis be improved?`,
          answer: `<p>To improve a prediction you can analyze the last 5 games like we offer in Winflix VIP. If a football prediction is based on a double chance, you can actually improve the prediction by combining it with a number of goals in the game or with a goalscorer. More and more bookmakers and sports betting providers are also offering game options such as "Team A wins or a draw AND more than 1.5 goals in the game". The prediction is then improved by adjusting it for the number of goals in play. This increases the probabilities and at the same time the risk for the prediction. We could also improve a prediction by thinking of putting a win AND a goalscorer on the same bet placed. For example, if PSG's odds against the last player seems too low, it might be interesting to improve the prediction by adding K. Mbappe as a goalscorer. The effect would be the same as before, the odds increase but the risk increases with it. Finally, one could imagine improving a football prediction in terms of prediction reliability. In this case you need to do the opposite, if a match is fully given, ie in 1X2, then it is advisable to fold with double chance. The effect will inevitably be a sinking of the coast, a decrease in potential profits, but, by analogy, an increase in the probability rate, and therefore the reliability of the forecast.</p>`,

          question: `What is the best soccer prediction website?`,

On Winflix you will find reliable football predictions created and selected by our sports betting experts, but also predictions for any football match and any league, European or World.

          question: `What is the best app to find football prediction?`,

                            <p>Winflix.net is the best football predictions website to advise demanding bettors. There are many other types of soccer prediction websites, we will describe in detail the 2 types of prediction websites that exist.</p>
                            <h3>The free football predictions website</h3>
                             <p>Free betting sites have pros and cons. For example, they are never really free. In reality, they are mainly paid for by advertising, and the largest advertising budget generated by these types of sites is that of bookmakers. So if you are looking for a free soccer predictions website, ask yourself the following question: Can I trust a paid predictions website from bookmakers and sports betting sites? The answer seems obvious, if you want to win your bets in the long run then using free prono sites is definitely not for you. That doesn't mean they don't hit the mark a few times, but if they make you win too much at your sports bets thanks to their free tips, it's because they're losing money at sports betting sites and under these conditions doesn't seem obvious that bookmakers continue to pay them. Here is our take on websites prone to "free" and finally we will remember that what is free has no value. You can also find a nice Winflix review article that includes all the tests done by others.</p>
                             <h3>Paid Tipster Sites</h3>
                             <p>Many tipsters evolve, but generally just trying them is enough to understand that you have just been scammed and that the football predictions on offer are neither more nor less than a feeling of the person behind them. The empirical values ââare generally very low and the forecasts do not correspond to the often advertised expectations of corrupt influencers. This page of all tipsters or tipsters does not necessarily have to be blocked. Likewise, many tipsters and tipster websites falsify their results in order to sell them. So don't hesitate to check the soccer predictions provided by the tipster before you pay. Some tipster sites can be marginally profitable (which is good enough when you see others letting you lose) and among the top tipsters, a large number don't follow, give advice on betting or sports betting strategy, but only give a few games of the time to time and gargle with poor results.</p>
